Cursor skills for backend

Add task-specific skill files in this folder when you want the agent to follow a repeatable procedure (e.g., API scaffolding, testing, deployment checks).

Suggested structure for a new skill:

- What the skill does
- When to use it
- Inputs it expects
- Step-by-step procedure
- Safety checks

Keep skills scoped to backend/ unless noted.
